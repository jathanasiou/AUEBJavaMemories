# AUEBJavaMemories

Quite a few years ago, three students at the _Athens University of Economics and Business_ were learning Java.

Their 2nd semester assignment code is shared here as a memento and a reminder of how far we can go.

... and also as a warning

- To never use your local language for comments
- To never use greeklish for naming classes and variables
- To never use the shorthand of a Greek-translated `Resolution` class [as a variable name](https://github.com/jathanasiou/AUEBJavaMemories/blob/14e7a84b51785a8eafceed7461855dcd2bdca1e6/src/Thleorash.java#L7)
- That writing a custom 200-line ["""parser"""](https://github.com/jathanasiou/AUEBJavaMemories/blob/14e7a84b51785a8eafceed7461855dcd2bdca1e6/src/Katasthma.java#L570) and 250-line ["""serializer"""](https://github.com/jathanasiou/AUEBJavaMemories/blob/14e7a84b51785a8eafceed7461855dcd2bdca1e6/src/Katasthma.java#L298) in your `Katasthma.java` class, which _somehow work_ for a [pseudo-JSON format](https://github.com/jathanasiou/AUEBJavaMemories/blob/main/src/Item.txt), may seem like a total genius move at the time but after many years the cursed code involving a dozen guard variables and another dozen nested `if-else` cases will be still haunting your memories
- ...and also that Reflection or meta properties like `foo.getClass().getName()` are about as awesome as they are disgusting. And single-letter variables names are a crime.
